║                               We play classic blackjack.                                  ║
║                                                                                           ║
║ At the beginning of each game, you place your bet. On the first circle, you get two       ║
║ cards face up. If the sum of your cards is 9, 10 or 11, then you can satisfy the rate     ║
║ After that, the dealer receives 1 card face up and 1 card face down. If after the first   ║
║ round the sum of your points is 21, then this is blackjack. Your bet is returned and you  ║
║ get x 1.5. At each new circle, you can take a new card or end the game. If you took a     ║
║ card and the sum of your points is more than 21, then the game ends and your bet goes to  ║
║ the dealer. If you finish the game and the sum of your points is more than the dealer's,  ║
║ or the dealer has more than 21, then you win and get x 1. Otherwise, the dealer wins and  ║
║ your bet goes to him. The dealer always draws cards as long as his total is less than 17. ║
║ The game continues until the sum of your points is not more than 21, or you do not want   ║
║ to finish.                                                                                ║
